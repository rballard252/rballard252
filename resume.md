Elite Martial Arts Brentwood is a mixed martial arts facility that teaches Krav Maga, Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and several other, less frequent, styles in addition to several weapons.
As an assistant instructor, I led and assisted mixed martial arts classes with children, teens, and adults aged 5-70. I also handled merchandise sales and relationships with parents and potential customers.
I was also often assigned to new students and those with special needs for one-on-one attention, fostering courage and confidence in them and patience and dilligence in me.
